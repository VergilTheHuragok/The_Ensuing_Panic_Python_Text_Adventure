Editor Problems:
If imports don't work, mark main package as sources root

If getting error where "new_file = eval(default_path_parts[-1][:-4])" thinks a
module does not exist, make sure "from core.config.config import *" is still at
the top of the file.

When updating version, copy and paste old project and rename with new version.
Mark old project as excluded and mark main in new project as source's root.
Change version in PyCharm run configurations script and working directory.
Change version in compile.bat and reupload to floobits by going to
"Tools>Floobits>Share Project Publicly."
Change requirements.txt path in File>Settings>Tools>Python Integrated Tools>The_Ensuing_Panic>Package Requirements File
